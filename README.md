# Sugar-Talking


#



**[Intro]**
Ooh, ooh, ooh

#

**[Chorus]**

Put your loving where your mouth is

Your sugar talking isn't working tonight, oh

Put your loving where your mouth is

Yeah, your paragraphs mean shit to me

Get your sorry ass to mine

#

**[Post-Chorus]**

Ooh, ooh, ooh

#

**[Verse 1]**

Saying that you miss me

Boy, do you win a prize?

You're havin' these epiphanies

Big word for a real small mind

And aren't you tired of saying a whole lot of nothing?

#

**[Refrain]**

You tell me that you want me (Want me)

But, baby, if you need me (Need me, oh)

#

**[Chorus]**

Put your loving where your mouth is

Your sugar talking isn't working tonight, oh

Say you're a big changed man, I doubt it

Yeah, your paragraphs mean shit to me

Get your sorry ass to mine

#

**[Post-Chorus]**

Ooh, ooh, ooh

#

**[Verse 2]**

You filled my whole apartment with flowers that die

The first to open up your wallet

But the last one to flag,

a heart only breaks so many times

Save your money and stop makin' me cry

#

**[Refrain]**

You tell me that you want me (Oh, I know what you want; want me)

But, baby, if you need me (Need me),

yeah

#

**[Bridge]**

Oh

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh

#

**[Chorus]**

Put your loving where your mouth is

Your sugar talking isn't working tonight, oh

Put your loving where your mouth is

Yeah, your paragraphs mean shit to me

It's verbatim what you said last week

It's your seventh last chance, honey

Get your sorry ass to mine
